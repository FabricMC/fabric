/**
 * Model resolvers are able to provide a custom model for specific {@link Identifier}s.
 * In vanilla, these {@link Identifier}s are converted to file paths and used to load
 * a model from JSON. Since model resolvers override this process, they can be used to
 * create custom model formats.
 *
 * <p>Only one resolver may provide a custom model for a certain {@link Identifier}.
 * Thus, resolvers that load models using a custom format could conflict. To avoid
 * conflicts, such resolvers may want to only load files with a mod-suffixed name
 * or only load files that have been explicitly defined elsewhere.
 *
 * <p>If it is necessary to load and bake an arbitrary model that is not referenced
 * normally, a model resolver can be used in conjunction with
 * {@link ModelLoadingPlugin.Context#addModels} to directly load and bake custom model
 * instances.
 *
 * <p>Model resolvers are invoked for <b>every single model that will be loaded</b>,
 * so implementations should be as efficient as possible.
 *

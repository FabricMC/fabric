/**
 * The Fabric screen handler API for creating screen handlers and screen handler types.
 *
 * <p>Screen handlers types are used to synchronize {@linkplain net.minecraft.screen.ScreenHandler screen handlers}
 * between the server and the client. Their main job is to create screen handler instances on the client.
 * Screen handlers manage the items and integer properties that are
 * needed to show on screens, such as the items in a chest or the progress of a furnace.
 *
 * <h2>Simple and extended screen handlers</h2>
 * "Simple" screen handlers are the type of screen handlers used in vanilla.
 * They can automatically synchronize items and integer properties between the server and the client,
 * but they don't support having custom data sent in the opening packet.
 * You can create simple screen handlers using vanilla's {@link net.minecraft.screen.ScreenHandlerType}.
 *
 * <p>This module adds <i>extended screen handlers</i> that can synchronize their own custom data
 * when they are opened, which can be useful for defining additional properties of a screen on the server.
 * For example, a mod can synchronize text that will show up as a label.
 * You can create extended screen handlers using
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.screenhandler.v1.ExtendedScreenHandlerType}.
 *
 * <h2>Opening screen handlers</h2>
 * Screen handlers can be opened using
 * {@link net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity#openHandledScreen(net.minecraft.screen.NamedScreenHandlerFactory)}.
 * Note that calling it on the logical client does nothing. To open an extended screen handler, the factory passed in
 * should be an {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.screenhandler.v1.ExtendedScreenHandlerFactory}.

The issues of the fabric GitHub repository is not the best place for you to get support for your issue. If you would like better and more immediate help with your issue please join the fabric discord server [here](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv), and ask for help in the #player-support channel.

If you are not getting the help you need on the discord server then try the following steps to resolve the issue yourself.

1. Check that your fabric loader installation is correct by removing all of the mods from your mod folder and running the game. If the game successfully loads continue to the next step. If not, then read the instructions [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) on how to properly install the fabric loader.
2. Remove all of the mods from your mod folder, and add them back one by one until you find which mod is the culprit. When you find which mod is responsible for the crashing, then look for a link to the sources for the mod and make an issue on the repository for that mod.
3. If none of that has worked then delete everything above this line (including this line) in the issue template, and fill in the rest of the template with information about your specific issue. Each of the fields are a title wrapped in two asterisks on either side. Next to them is a descriptor written in all caps wrapped in square brackets on either side. Replace the descriptor and the square brackets with the right information specific to your issue.

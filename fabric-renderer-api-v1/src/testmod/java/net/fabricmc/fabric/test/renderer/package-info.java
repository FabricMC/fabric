 * The testmod for the Fabric Renderer API.
 * Right now there is only one test here, but more tests may come to exist in the future.
 * These tests are used to validate Indigo's implementation is correct, but these tests may also be useful for other implementations of the Fabric Renderer API.
 *
 * <p>Right now there is a simple test in the {@code simple} package which validates that simple meshes and quad emitters function.
 * Future tests may look into testing things such as render materials or creating more advanced models.

/**
 * The testmod for the Fabric Renderer API. These tests are used to validate that
 * Indigo's implementation is correct, but they may also be useful for other
 * implementations of the Fabric Renderer API.
 *
 * <h3>Tests</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Frame blocks display another block inside, scaled down and made translucent.
 *     Blocks that provide a block entity cannot be placed inside frames.
 *
 *     <li>Pillars connect vertically with each other by changing textures. They also
 *     connect vertically to frame blocks containing a pillar, and vice versa.
 *
 *     <li>Octagonal columns have irregular faces to test enhanced AO and normal shade. The
 *     octagonal item column has glint force enabled on all faces except the top and bottom
 *     faces.
 * </ul>

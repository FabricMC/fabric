/**
 * An attachment allows "attaching" arbitrary data to various game objects (entities, block entities, worlds and chunks at the moment).
 * Use the methods provided in {@link AttachmentRegistry} to create and register attachments. Attachments can
 * optionally be made to persist between restarts using a provided {@link Codec}.
 *
 * <p>While the API places no restrictions on the types of data that can be attached, it is generally encouraged to use
 * immutable types. More generally, different attachments <i>must not</i> share mutable state, and it is <i>strongly advised</i>
 * for attachments not to hold internal references to their target. See the following note on entity targets.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note on {@link Entity} and {@link Chunk} targets: in several instances, the game needs to copy data from one instance to another.
 * These are player respawning, mob conversion, return from the End, cross-world entity teleportation, and conversion of a {@link ProtoChunk} to
 * {@link WorldChunk}. By default, attachments are simply copied wholesale, up to {@link #copyOnDeath()}. Since one instance is discarded,
 * an attachment that keeps a reference to an {@link Entity} or {@link ProtoChunk} instance can and will break unexpectedly. If,
 * for whatever reason, keeping a reference to the target is absolutely necessary, be sure to implement custom copying logic.
 * For {@link Entity} targets, use {@link ServerPlayerEvents#COPY_FROM}, {@link ServerEntityWorldChangeEvents#AFTER_ENTITY_CHANGE_WORLD},
 * and {@link ServerLivingEntityEvents#MOB_CONVERSION}. For {@link Chunk} targets, mixin into
 * {@link WorldChunk#WorldChunk(ServerWorld, ProtoChunk, WorldChunk.EntityLoader)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <A> type of the attached data. It is encouraged for this to be an immutable type.

 * Provides access to block mining levels.

 * <h2>Mining level tags</h2>
 * {@code MiningLevelManager} supports the vanilla minimum mining level tags:
 * {@link net.minecraft.tag.BlockTags#NEEDS_STONE_TOOL #needs_stone_tool},
 * {@link net.minecraft.tag.BlockTags#NEEDS_IRON_TOOL #needs_iron_tool} and
 * {@link net.minecraft.tag.BlockTags#NEEDS_DIAMOND_TOOL #needs_diamond_tool}.
 * In addition to them, you can use dynamic mining level tags for any mining level (such as wood, netherite
 * or a custom one). The dynamic tags are checked automatically.
 *
 * <p>Dynamic mining level tags are in the format {@code #fabric:needs_tool_level_N}, where {@code N}
 * is the wanted tool level as an integer. For example, a mining level tag for netherite (mining level 4) would be
 * {@code #fabric:needs_tool_level_4}.

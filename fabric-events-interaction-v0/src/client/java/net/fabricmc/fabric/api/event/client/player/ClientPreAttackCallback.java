 * This event fires every tick when the attack key (left mouse button by default) is in pressed state.
 * If the callback returns true,
 * the vanilla handling (block breaking, entity attacking, hand swing) will be cancelled,
 * and the later callbacks of this event are also cancelled.
 *
 * <p>This event is client-only, which means handling it may require sending custom packets.
 *
 * <p>The event fires both when clicking and holding attack key.
 * To check whether the attack key is just clicked, use {@code clickCount != 0}
 *
 * <p>The vanilla attack cooldown and player game mode does not affect this event.
 * The mod probably needs to check {@link net.minecraft.client.MinecraftClient#attackCooldown} and the game mode.
 * {@link net.minecraft.entity.player.ItemCooldownManager} can be used for custom item cooldown handling.

/**
 * Callback for when any fluid tries to flow or has a neighbor update.
 *
 * <p>The default behavior is to return {@code true}, which means that the fluid is allowed to flow.
 * <br/>By returning {@code false}, you are saying that you are preventing the fluid from flowing, canceling all further callbacks.
 *
 * <p>Note: Not updating the block state at the fluid position and returning {@code false} will likely cause unintended behavior, as fluids that could flow won't.

	 * Loads the audio stream for this sound.
	 *
	 * <p>By default this will load {@code .ogg} files from active resource packs. It may be overridden to provide a
	 * custom {@link AudioStream} implementation which provides audio from another source, such as over the network or
	 * driven from user input.
	 *
	 * <h3>Usage Example</h3>
	 *
	 * <p>Creating a sound with a custom audio stream requires the following:
	 *
	 * <p>Firstly, an entry in {@code sounds.json}. The name can be set to any sound (though it is recommended to use
	 * the dummy {@link #EMPTY_SOUND}), and the "stream" property set to true:
	 *
	 * <pre>{@code
	 * {
	 *   "custom_sound": {"sounds": [{"name": "fabric-sound-api-v1:empty", "stream": true}]}
	 * }
	 * }</pre>
	 *
	 * <p>You should then define your own implementation of {@link AudioStream}, which provides audio data to the sound
	 * engine.
	 *
	 * <p>Finally, you'll need an implementation of {@link SoundInstance} which overrides {@link #getAudioStream} to
	 * return your custom implementation. {@link SoundInstance#getSound()} should return the newly-added entry in
	 * {@code sounds.json}.
	 *
	 * <pre>{@code
	 * class CustomSound extends AbstractSoundInstance {
	 *     CustomSound() {
	 *         // Use the sound defined in sounds.json
	 *         super(Identifier.of("mod_id", "custom_sound"), SoundCategory.BLOCKS, SoundInstance.createRandom());
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     @Override
	 *     public CompletableFuture<AudioStream> getAudioStream(SoundLoader loader, Identifier id, boolean repeatInstantly) {
	 *         // Return your custom AudioStream implementation.
	 *         return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(new CustomStream());
	 *     }
	 * }
	 * }</pre>
	 *
	 * @param loader          The default sound loader, capable of loading {@code .ogg} files.
	 * @param id              The resolved sound ID, equal to {@link SoundInstance#getSound()}'s location.
	 * @param repeatInstantly Whether this sound should loop. This is true when the sound
	 *                        {@linkplain SoundInstance#isRepeatable() is repeatable} and has
	 *                        {@linkplain SoundInstance#getRepeatDelay() no delay}.
	 * @return the loaded audio stream

 * A {@code Storage<ItemVariant>} implementation for a {@link PlayerInventory}.
 * This is a specialized version of {@link InventoryStorage},
 * with an additional transactional wrapper for {@link PlayerInventory#offerOrDrop}.
 *
 * <p>Note that this is a wrapper around all the slots of the player inventory.
 * However, {@link #insert} is overriden to behave like {@link #offer}.
 * For simple insertions, {@link #offer} or {@link #offerOrDrop} is recommended.
 * {@link #getSlots} can also be used and combined with {@link CombinedStorage} to retrieve a wrapper around a specific range of slots.
 *
 * <p><b>Experimental feature</b>, we reserve the right to remove or change it without further notice.
 * The transfer API is a complex addition, and we want to be able to correct possible design mistakes.

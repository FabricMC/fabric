/**
 * A global operation where participants guarantee atomicity: either the whole operation succeeds,
 * or it is completely aborted and rolled back.
 *
 * <p>One can imagine that transactions are like video game checkpoints.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@linkplain #openOuter Opening a transaction} with a try-with-resources block creates a checkpoint.</li>
 *     <li>Modifications to game state can then happen.</li>
 *     <li>Calling {@link #commit} validates the modifications that happened during the transaction,
 *     essentially discarding the checkpoint.</li>
 *     <li>Calling {@link #abort} or doing nothing and letting the transaction be {@linkplain #close closed} at the end
 *     of the try-with-resources block cancels any modification that happened during the transaction,
 *     reverting to the checkpoint.</li>
 *     <li>Calling {@link #openNested} on a transaction creates a new nested transaction, i.e. a new checkpoint with the current state.
 *     Committing a nested transaction will validate the changes that happened, but they may
 *     still be cancelled later if a parent transaction is cancelled.
 *     Aborting a nested transaction immediately reverts the changes - cancelling any modification made after the call
 *     to {@link #openNested}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is illustrated in the following example.
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (Transaction outerTransaction = Transaction.openOuter()) {
 *     // (A) some transaction operations
 *     try (Transaction nestedTransaction = outerTransaction.openNested()) {
 *         // (B) more operations
 *         nestedTransaction.commit(); // Validate the changes that happened in this transaction.
 *                                     // This is a nested transaction, so changes will only be applied if the outer
 *                                     // transaction is committed too.
 *     }
 *     // (C) even more operations
 *     outerTransaction.commit(); // This is an outer transaction: changes (A), (B) and (C) are applied.
 * }
 * // If we hadn't committed the outerTransaction, all changes (A), (B) and (C) would have been reverted.
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Participants are responsible for upholding this contract themselves, by using {@link #addCloseCallback}
 * to react to transaction close events and properly validate or revert changes.
 * Any action that modifies state outside of the transaction, such as calls to {@code markDirty()} or neighbor updates,
 * should be deferred until {@linkplain #addOuterCloseCallback after the outer transaction is closed}
 * to give every participant a chance to react to transaction close events.
 *
 * <p>This is very low-level for most applications, and most participants should subclass {@link SnapshotParticipant}
 * that will take care of properly maintaining their state.
 *
 * <p>Participants should generally be passed a {@link TransactionContext} parameter instead of the full {@code Transaction},
 * to make sure they don't call {@link #abort}, {@link #commit} or {@link #close} mistakenly.
 *
 * <p>Every transaction is only valid on the thread it was opened on,
 * and attempts to use it on another thread will throw an exception.
 * Consequently, transactions can be concurrent across multiple threads, as long as they don't share any state.
 *
 * <p><b>Experimental feature</b>, we reserve the right to remove or change it without further notice.
 * The transfer API is a complex addition, and we want to be able to correct possible design mistakes.

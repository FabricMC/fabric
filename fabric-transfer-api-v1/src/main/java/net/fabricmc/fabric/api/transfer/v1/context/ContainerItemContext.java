/**
 * A context that allows an item-queried {@link Storage} implementation to interact with its containing inventory,
 * such as a player inventory or an emptying or filling machine.
 * For example, it is what allows the {@code Storage<FluidVariant>} of a water bucket to replace the full bucket by an empty bucket
 * on extraction.
 * Such items that contain resources are often referred to as "container items".
 *
 * <p>When an {@linkplain ItemApiLookup item API} requires a {@code ContainerItemContext} as context,
 * it will generally be suitable to obtain a context instance with {@link #ofPlayerHand} or {@link #ofPlayerCursor},
 * and then use {@link #find} to query an API instance.
 *
 * <p>When water is extracted from the {@code Storage} of a water bucket, this is how it interacts with the context:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The first step is to remove one water bucket item from the current slot,
 *     that is the slot that contains the water bucket.</li>
 *     <li>The second step is to try to add one empty bucket item to the current slot, at the same position.</li>
 *     <li>If that fails, the third step is to add the empty bucket item somewhere else in the inventory.</li>
 *     <li>The water extraction can only proceed if both step 1, and step 2 or 3, succeed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Before attempting to change the current item, the {@code Storage} implementation must of course check that
 * the item in the current slot is still a water bucket.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ContainerItemContext} allows these operations to be performed, thanks to the following parts:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@linkplain #getMainSlot The main slot} or current slot of the context, containing the item the API was queried for initially.
 *     In the example above, this is the slot containing the water bucket, used for steps 1 and 2.</li>
 *     <li>{@linkplain #insertOverflow An overflow insertion function}, that can be used to insert items into the context's inventory
 *     when insertion into a specific slot fails. In our example above, this is the function used for step 3.</li>
 *     <li>The context may also contain additional slots, accessible through {@link #getAdditionalSlots}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementors of item APIs can freely use these methods, but most will generally want to use the following convenience methods instead:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Query which variant is currently in the main slot through {@link #getItemVariant}.
 *     <b>It is important to check this before any operation, to make sure the item variant hasn't changed since the query.</b></li>
 *     <li>Query how much of the (non-blank) variant is in the inventory through {@link #getAmount}.</li>
 *     <li>Extract some items from the main slot with {@link #extract}. In the water bucket example, this can be used for step 1.</li>
 *     <li>Insert some items, either into the main slot if possible or the rest of the inventory otherwise, with {@link #insert}.
 *     In the water bucket example, this can be used for steps 2 and 3.</li>
 *     <li>Exchange some of the current variant with another variant through {@link #exchange}.
 *     In the water bucket example, this function can be used to combine steps 1, 2 and 3.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Experimental feature</b>, we reserve the right to remove or change it without further notice.
 * The transfer API is a complex addition, and we want to be able to correct possible design mistakes.

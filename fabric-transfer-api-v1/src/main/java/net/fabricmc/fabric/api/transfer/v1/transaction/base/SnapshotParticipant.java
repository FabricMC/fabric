/**
 * A base participant implementation that modifies itself during transactions,
 * saving snapshots of its state in objects of type {@code T} in case it needs to revert to a previous state.
 *
 * <h3>How to use from subclasses</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Call {@link #updateSnapshots} right before the state of your subclass is modified in a transaction.</li>
 *     <li>Override {@link #createSnapshot}: it is called when necessary to create an object representing the state of your subclass.</li>
 *     <li>Override {@link #readSnapshot}: it is called when necessary to revert to a previous state of your subclass.</li>
 *     <li>You may optionally override {@link #onFinalCommit}: it is called at the of a transaction that modified the state.
 *     For example, it could contain a call to {@code markDirty()}.</li>
 *     <li>(Advanced!) You may optionally override {@link #releaseSnapshot}: it is called once a snapshot object will not be used,
 *     for example you may wish to pool expensive state objects.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>More technical explanation</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@link #updateSnapshots} should be called before any modification.
 * This will save the state of this participant using {@link #createSnapshot} if no state was already saved for that transaction.
 * When the transaction is aborted and changes need to be rolled back, {@link #readSnapshot} will be called
 * to signal that the current state should revert to that of the snapshot.
 * The snapshot object is then {@linkplain #releaseSnapshot released}, and can be cached for subsequent use, or discarded.
 *
 * <p>When an outer transaction is committed, {@link #readSnapshot} will not be called so that the current state of this participant
 * is retained. {@link #releaseSnapshot} will be called because the snapshot is not necessary anymore,
 * and {@link #onFinalCommit} will be called after the transaction is closed.
 *
 * @param <T> The objects that this participant uses to save its state snapshots.
 *
 * <b>Experimental feature</b>, we reserve the right to remove or change it without further notice.
 * The transfer API is a complex addition, and we want to be able to correct possible design mistakes.

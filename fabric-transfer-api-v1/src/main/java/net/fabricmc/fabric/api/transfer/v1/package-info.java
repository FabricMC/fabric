/**
 * <h1>The Transfer API, version 1.</h1>
 *
 * <p>This module provides common facilities for the transfer of fluids and other game resources.
 *
 * <p><h2>Transactions</h2>
 * The {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.transaction.Transaction Transaction} system provides a
 * scope that can be used to simulate any number of transfer operations, and then cancel or validate all of them at once.
 * One can think of transactions as video game checkpoints. A more detailed explanation can be found in the class javadoc of {@code Transaction}.
 * Every transfer operation requires a {@code Transaction} parameter.
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.transaction.base.SnapshotParticipant SnapshotParticipant}
 * is the reference implementation of a "participant", that is an object participating in a transaction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><h2>Storages</h2>
 * A {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.storage.Storage Storage&lt;T&gt;} is any object that can store resources of type {@code T}.
 * Its contents can be read, and resources can be inserted into it or extracted from it.
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.storage.Movement Movement} can be used to move resources between two {@code Storage}s.
 * The {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.storage.base storage/base package} provides a few helpers to accelerate
 * implementation of {@code Storage&lt;T&gt;}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><h2>Fluid transfer</h2>
 * A {@code Storage<FluidKey>} is any object that can store fluids. It is just a {@code Storage&lt;T&gt;}, where {@code T} is
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.fluid.FluidKey FluidKey}, the immutable combination of a {@code Fluid} and additional NBT data.
 * Instances can be accessed through the API lookups defined in {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.fluid.FluidTransfer FluidTransfer}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Implementors of fluid inventories with a fixed number of "slots" or "tanks" can use
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.fluid.base.SingleFluidStorage SingleFluidStorage},
 * and combine them with {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.storage.base.CombinedStorage CombinedStorage}.
 * Usage of {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.fluid.FluidPreconditions FluidPreconditions} is recommended to detect
 * wrong usage of {@code Storage} and {@code StorageView} methods.
 *
 * <p>The amount for fluid transfer is droplets, that is 1/81000ths of a bucket.
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.fluid.FluidConstants FluidConstants} contains a few helpful constants to work with droplets.
 *
 * <p>Client-side {@linkplain net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.client.fluid.FluidKeyRendering fluid key rendering} will use regular fluid rendering by default,
 * ignoring the additional NBT data.
 * {@code Fluid}s that wish to render differently depending on the stored NBT data can register a
 * {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.transfer.v1.client.fluid.FluidKeyRenderHandler FluidKeyRenderHandler}.

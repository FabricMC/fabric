# Fabric API

Essential hooks for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.
- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.
- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.

Also check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.

For support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).

## Using Fabric API to play with mods

Make sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

To use Fabric API, download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/releases).

The downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.

## Using Fabric API to develop mods

To setup a Fabric development environment, check out the [Fabric example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) and follow the instructions there. The example mod already depends on Fabric API.

To include the full Fabric API with all modules in the development environment, add the following to your `dependencies` block in the gradle buildscript:

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
modImplementation "net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION"
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
modImplementation("net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION")
```

Alternatively, modules from Fabric API can be specified individually as shown below:

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
// Make a collection of all api modules we wish to use
Set<String> apiModules = [
    "fabric-api-base",
    "fabric-command-api-v1",
    "fabric-lifecycle-events-v1",
    "fabric-networking-v0"
]

// Add each module as a dependency
apiModules.forEach {
    modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION))
}
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
// Make a set of all api modules we wish to use
setOf(
    "fabric-api-base",
    "fabric-command-api-v1",
    "fabric-lifecycle-events-v1",
    "fabric-networking-v0"
).forEach {
    // Add each module as a dependency
    modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION))
}
```

<!--Linked to gradle documentation on properties-->
Instead of hardcoding version constants all over the build script, Gradle properties may be used to replace these constants. Properties are defined in the `gradle.properties` file at the root of a project. More information is available [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#declare_properties_in_gradle_properties_file).

See something Fabric API doesn't support, a bug or something that may be useful? We welcome contributions to improve Fabric API.

\* The contributing guidelines are work in progress

## Modules

Fabric API is designed to be modular for ease of updating. This also has the advantage of splitting up the codebase into smaller chunks.

Each module contains its own `README.md`* explaining the module's purpose and additional info on using the module.

\* The README for each module is being worked on; not every module has a README at the moment

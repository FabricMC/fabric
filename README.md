# Fabric API

Essential hooks and patches for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interop mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.
- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.
- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.

Also check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.

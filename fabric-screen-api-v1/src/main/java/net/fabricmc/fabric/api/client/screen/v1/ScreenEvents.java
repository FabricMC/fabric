	 * An event that is called after a {@link Screen#init(MinecraftClient, int, int) screen is initialized} to it's default state.
	 *
	 * <p>Typically this event is used to modify a screen after the screen has been initialized.
	 * Modifications such as changing sizes of buttons, removing buttons and adding/removing child elements to the screen can be done safely using this callback.
	 *
	 * <p>For example, to add a button to the title screen, the following code could be used:
	 * <blockquote><pre>
	 * ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT.register((client, screen, info, scaledWidth, scaledHeight) -> {
	 * 	if (screen instanceof TitleScreen) {
	 * 		context.getButtons().add(new ButtonWidget(...));
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * </pre></blockquote>
	 *
	 * <p>The {@link FabricScreen} provided by the {@code info} parameter may be used to register tick and render events.
	 * For example, to register an event on inventory like screens after render, the following code could be used:
	 * <blockquote><pre>
	 * &#64;Override
	 * public void onInitializeClient() {
	 * 	ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT.register((client, screen, info, scaledWidth, scaledHeight) -> {
	 * 		if (screen instanceof AbstractInventoryScreen) {
	 * 			info.getAfterRenderEvent().register(this::onRenderInventoryScreen);
	 * 		}
	 * 	});
	 * }
	 *
	 * private void onRenderInventoryScreen(MinecraftClient client, MatrixStack matrices, Screen screen, FabricScreen info, int mouseX, int mouseY, float tickDelta) {
	 * 	...
	 * }
	 * </pre></blockquote>
	 *
	 * <p>This event also indicates that the previous screen has been closed, and as such can be used to clear a mod's current screen state.

	 * to be added before calling this method to ensure the packets are sent. Notable examples include:
	 *
	 * <ul>

	 *         of this method to handle this case.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>It may be tempting to call {@link ClientGameTestContext#waitTick()} instead of this method. This often appears to work,
	 * especially in singleplayer, since packets can often take less than a tick to arrive. However it is not 100% reliable and
	 * will produce flaky tests. For a similar reason, forgetting to call {@link ClientGameTestContext#waitTick()} before this
	 * method for a block change often works anyway, since the packets sent by the server batching block updates can still arrive
	 * before control is returned to the client gametest thread, however this is not guaranteed.

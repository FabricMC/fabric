/**
 * Offers access to play stage server-side networking functionalities.
 *
 * <p>Server-side networking functionalities include receiving serverbound packets, sending clientbound packets, and events related to server-side network handlers.
 *
 * <p>This class should be only used for the logical server.
 *
 * <h2>Packet object-based API</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class provides a classic registration method, {@link #registerGlobalReceiver(Identifier, PlayChannelHandler)},
 * and a newer method utilizing packet objects, {@link #registerGlobalReceiver(PacketType, PlayPacketHandler)}.
 * For most mods, using the newer method will improve the readability of the code by separating packet
 * reading/writing code to a separate class. Additionally, the newer method executes the callback in the
 * server thread, ensuring thread safety. For this reason using the newer method is highly recommended.
 * The two methods are network-compatible with each other, so long as the buffer contents are read and written
 * in the same order.
 *
 * <p>The newer, packet object-based API involves three classes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A class implementing {@link FabricPacket} that is "sent" over the network</li>
 *     <li>{@link PacketType} instance, which represents the packet's type (and its channel)</li>
 *     <li>{@link PlayPacketHandler}, which handles the packet (usually implemented as a functional interface)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>See the documentation on each class for more information.

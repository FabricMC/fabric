/**
 * Provides a way of conditionally loading JSON-based resources. By default, this can
 * be used with recipes, loot tables, advancements, predicates, and item modifiers.
 * Conditions are identified by an identifier and registered at {@link
 * net.fabricmc.fabric.api.resource.conditions.v1.ResourceConditions}.
 *
 * <h2>JSON format</h2>
 *
 * <p>Add an array with the {@code fabric:load_conditions} key to the JSON file:
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   "type": "minecraft:crafting_shapeless",
 *   "ingredients": [
 *     {
 *       "item": "minecraft:dirt"
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   "result": {
 *     "item": "minecraft:diamond"
 *   },
 *   "fabric:load_conditions": [
 *     {
 *       "condition": "<insert condition ID here>",
 *       // values of the condition
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>See {@link net.fabricmc.fabric.api.resource.conditions.v1.DefaultResourceConditions} for
 * the list of built-in conditions. It is also possible to register a custom condition.
 *
 * <h2>Data generation integration</h2>
 *
 * <p>Fabric Data Generation API supports adding a {@link
 * net.fabricmc.fabric.api.resource.conditions.v1.ConditionJsonProvider} to a generated file.
 * Please check the documentation of the Data Generation API.
